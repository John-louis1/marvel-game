<h1 align="center">MARVEL ULTIMATE WAR ðŸ”¥</h1>



## Description
This is a two-player game with the theme of Marvel Ultimate War in which each player chooses 3 champions
and promotes one of the champions to be a leader. The goal of the game is to defeat all champions
of the opponent team. During each turn, a champion has a limited number of action points with which he can move on the board, attack, and cast abilities.
On a leader champion's turn, he can also cast a leader ability, which can only be used once throughout the game. Abilities have three types: Damaging
Abilities, Healing Abilities, and Crowd Control Abilities. Damaging abilities decrease the targets' health points, while healing abilities increase the
targets' health points, whereas crowd control abilities apply a certain effect on targets. There are 10 effects in the game: 5 positive effects (buff)
and 5 negative effects (debuff), each with different usages.
